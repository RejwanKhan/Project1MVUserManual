              One of my biggest hobbies is playing Video Games! I really love
              playing games like Final Fantasy VII Remake, Hades and a lot of
              two player games such as It takes Two, Escape Simulator, We were
              here Together and choice decision games such as The Wolf Among us.

              I think playing Video Games is a great way of relaxing or keeping
              your brain active when you play problem-solving games (which is
              one of my favourite) as some of the problems are really difficult
              and makes you think for hours. Its a great way for me and my
              friends to have fun together.

            <h2>Pig Owner</h2>
            <p>
              Pig Owner One of my biggest dreams is to own a pet Pig called
              Rufus, I've always wanted a pet Pig because I find them adorable
              and a way better pet compared to other domesticated pets such as
              dogs and cats. I hope to have Rufus when I am financially free and
              have a huge house and space for him as he needs a big space to
              grow. Even though they are micropigs they don't stay micro!. I'm
              not interested in having children but I am really keen on having
              Rufus in my life later down the future.

            <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>
              I love programming, in fact that I spent so much of my free time
              learning programming by myself since I was unable to do it in A
              Levels. I think that I learnt so much in a short amount of time
              and I think I am really impressed by how fast I have learnt and
              the fact that I have an apprenticeship in Expedia, working in the
              experimentation team.
