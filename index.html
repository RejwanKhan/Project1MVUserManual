            Hey! My name is Rejwan and i am a part of the Experimentation team
            of Expedia. I'm looking forward to be an apprentice at Expedia Group
            particularly the experimentation team because I am fascinated at how
            experimentation works at Expedia Group.
          </p>

          <p class="roleDescription">
            In the Experimentation team we are responsible for creating new
            features that our partners want in order to increase revenue, we
            implement them and then we test whether that feature would attract
            more bookings or not. If so then we implement the change so that all
            the users experiences it and if not we discard it. Our Experiements
            tend to last two weeks or more and may be based on different metrics
            such as creating a new feature that would make it easier for
            customers to check dates on whether what hotel is available for
            their holiday, this is important because if a customer puts in their
            dates for their holiday they are 6 times more likely to make a
            booking with us!

          I love programming, I had no experience with programming at all, I did
          not have a formal education in computer science or programming and I
          was interested in it when I saw my friend code at first I found it
          confusing so he insisted that I give it a go and so I did and I
          enjoyed it. I started with Python and I've watched many youtube
          tutorials and read many python books including the Python Crash Course
          book which was beginner friendly but also told me all the fundamentals
          of programming such as arrays, objects and classes. I had no way of
          doing computer science in University because of the subjects I chose:
          History, Psychology and Economics. I did not want to further my
          education in going university because I decided it was not for me and
          hence I took an apprenticeship at Expedia Group!

          I think one thing about me that you all should know is that I am very
          hardworking and resilient for example if I do not know something I
          will go and research it in my free time to make sure that i
          understand. Furthermore, if there is a problem solving question I am
          struggling with I will take my time and think of different approaches
          and solutions to tackle the question rather than just looking up the
          answer - that makes me feel really good about myself.
