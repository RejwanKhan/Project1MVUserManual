              This is a picture of me on the tube travelling for the first
              holiday outside London, Bath!. I went to Bath for a week to visit
              a friend of mine who was going to study at Bath University, so I
              no longer have the same amount of time to see him again. I really
              Enjoyed Bath especially eating at Hudston Steak House, The best
              Steak-house in Bath.
