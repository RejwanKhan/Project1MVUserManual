      <p class="projectSummary">
        I have never used the Pygame module so I used a Youtube tutorial and other resources to learn how to use the module, in which I was successful making my first Snake Game. 
        I had issues in running the code due to the different type of input players can use to move the snake's direction, in order to solve this I imported enum to make sure that pressing
         the arrow keys would control the snake's body instead of keys such as 'r'.

      <h2>Project 2 : Guessing Game</h2>
      <img
        src="/Images/guessingGame.png "
        alt="An image of the author's Guessing game that he created"
      />
      <p class="projectSummary">
     For this Project I did not create the HTML or Css of this Project, but I implemented all the Javascript features needed for a Guessing Game to function properly.
     This project took me a day, I had lots of fun  writing arrow functions and manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) with Javascript so when you win it will say you win!
     and if you lose then you have to play again.
